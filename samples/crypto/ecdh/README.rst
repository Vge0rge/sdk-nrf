Overview
********

The ECDH sample shows how to perform an Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman key exhange to allow two parties to obtain a common secret.

The sample peforms an ECDH exchange:
   #. The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API is initialized.
   #. Two ECDH keypairs are generated and imported to the PSA keystore.
   #. ECDH key echange is performed.
   #. The keypairs are removed from the PSA keystore.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

   :rows:  nrf5340pdk_nrf5340_cpuappns, nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuappns, nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns


Building and running

Testing
=======================

Follow these steps to test the ECDH example:

1. Start a terminal emulator like PuTTY and connect to the used COM port with the following UART settings:

   * Baud rate: 115.200
   * 8 data bits
   * 1 stop bit
   * No parity
   * HW flow control: None
#. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe the logs from the application using an RTT Viewer or a terminal emulator.

.. note::
   By default, the sample is configured to use both RTT and UART for logging.
   If you are using RTT, skip the first step of the testing procedure.
